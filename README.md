### TextTalk

## TO USE:

- Open `TextTalk.xcworkspace` file to build the project


## Bugs
- You may experience issues using switching from Speech-to-Text to Text-To-Speech. If so, begin testing from Text-To-Speech.
- The signaling server is not properly configurated yet, so calls may not reach the other user.
